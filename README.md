C-Mouse is the Coolest Mouse Ever!

This project provides an ability to control Desktop mouse through the motion sensing of Android smartphone. It also supports gestures detection on smartphone for performing customizable shortcuts on the Desktop. If a Gyroscope Sensor is present on the device, the project will use the same for the motion sensing, else it will use the Magnetometer on the device.

## How to use? 
Make sure both the Android smartphone and Desktop are on same private network. Launch the Android App and Desktop server. Then wait() for Magic to happen!
