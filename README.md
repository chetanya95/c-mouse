C-Mouse is the Coolest Mouse Ever!

This project allows controlling Desktop mouse through Android smartphone's motion detection. It also supports smartphone's gestures detection for performing customizable shortcuts on the Desktop. The Android App will use Gyroscope Sensor for motion detection if it is present, else it will use Magnetometer.

## How to use? 
Make sure both the Android smartphone and Desktop are on same private network. Launch the Android App and Desktop server. Then wait() for Magic to happen!
