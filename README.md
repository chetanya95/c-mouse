C-Mouse is the Coolest Mouse Ever!

You can control your Desktop mouse with the motion sensors of your Android smartphone through this project. The project can also detect gestures performed on your smartphone for performing customizable shortcuts on the Desktop. The project will use Gyroscope sensor for motion detection if it has one, else it will use Magnetometer (which almost every smartphone has).

## How to use? 
Make sure both the Android smartphone and Desktop are on same private network. Launch the Android App and Desktop server. Then wait() for Magic to happen!
